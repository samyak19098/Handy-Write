	<div id = "heading">ABOUT</div>
	<div id = "main_body">Handy- write is an interactive writing platform developed to aid parents in teaching their children writing. Using its kid- friendly interface and an interactive environment, it is the ideal tool for your kid to learn and practice writing. It is also accompanied with an improved vocabulary. We use a third party whiteboard - <strong>Air Sketch</strong> - to project the writing on a </div><div id = "main_body2">computer. We use <strong>Tesseract.js</strong> to identify the written text. It is a JavaScript port for the Tesseract library developed for Java. A striking feature of Handy- write is the use of an <strong>LDR</strong>, <strong>active buzzer</strong> and <strong>touch sensor</strong> to make the platform not only more interactive but also allowing the kid to work in a safe environment by ensuring he/she is working in proper lighting conditions. Accessibility is another thing that we kept in mind while designing the platform. Each webpage has an option of enabling <strong>voiceover</strong> which helps the visually impaired in writing just as good as everyone else. Overall, we have tried to incorporate the needs of every child and based our project on feedback taken form 7 parents of 5-7 year-olds. We hope that you have a nice learning experience üòÅ.</div>
